The Todo List is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage their tasks in a convenient way. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks as needed. This project serves as a starting point for building a more advanced task management system.

Features
Task Creation: Users can easily create new tasks by entering the task name and clicking the "Add" button.

Task Completion: Completed tasks can be marked as done by clicking a checkbox or a specific UI element associated with each task.

Task Deletion: Unwanted tasks can be deleted from the list by clicking a delete button or a designated UI element.

Technologies Used
HTML: Used to structure the web page and define the elements.
CSS: Applied to style and enhance the visual presentation of the web page.
JavaScript: Implemented to add interactivity and functionality to the Todo List.
DOM Manipulation: Utilized to dynamically update the task list based on user actions.
Event Handling: Implemented to capture and respond to user interactions with the Todo List.
Getting Started
To run the Todo List locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the project files.

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Start managing your tasks by adding, completing, or deleting items from the list.

Future Enhancements
The Todo List project can be extended and enhanced in various ways:

Local Storage: Implementing local storage functionality to persist the task list across page refreshes.
Task Filtering: Adding options to filter tasks based on their completion status (e.g., showing only completed or active tasks).
Task Sorting: Implementing sorting options to arrange tasks based on priority, due date, or alphabetical order.
User Authentication: Adding user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own personalized task lists.
Responsive Design: Enhancing the project's responsiveness to ensure a seamless experience on different devices and screen sizes.
